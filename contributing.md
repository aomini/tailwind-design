# How contribution works?

At this time of phase we only have plain html & javascript components. Later we'll move 'em to modern frontend framework components.

# Usage

1. Clone the repo and do yarn install.
2. Run testing in src/index.html.
3. Also, run the tailwind compiler wit `yarn dev`.
4. Start the `index.html` with vscode live server.
5. After you're done with your component create a `<file>/index.md` in src/docs and paste in the code and some description about your component. Also, add a demo image of that component.
6. Finally, pull request to the main branch and update your code accordingly.

**Thanks for contributing**
