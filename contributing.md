# How contribution works?

At this time of phase we only have plain html & javascript components. Later we'll move 'em to modern frontend framework components.

# Usage

1. Clone the repo and do yarn install.
2. Run testing in src/index.html.
3. Also, run the tailwind compiler wit `yarn dev`.
4. Start the `index.html` with vscode live server.
5. After you're done with your component create a `<file>/index.md` in src/docs and paste in the code and some description about your component. Also, add a demo image of that component.
6. Finally, pull request to the main branch and update your code accordingly.
7. If you have custom css for the component then also paste the css code inside the index.md file. Without the css code the component will be different.
